install command for automatic infinite scrolling:

  npm install --save react-infinite-scroll-component

Library for time calculation:

npm i ms

need to install type declarations for this file separately


We need types only for development and not for production So we are
not going to ship them with our application to the client. So we need 
to install this as a development dependency. 

npm i --save-dev @types/ms
or
npm i -D @types/ms
